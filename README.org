* Dotbot =brew= plugin

Plugin for [[https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot][dotbot]] that adds =brew= and =cask= directives. It allows installation of
packages using =brew= and =brew cask= on OS X. In case =brew= is not installed, it
will be automatically loaded and configured. The plugin itself is pretty silly
as it doesn't handle updates and fails on unsupported operating systems.

** Installation

Just add it as submodule of your dotfiles repository.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git submodule add https://github.com/d12frosted/dotbot-brew.git
#+END_SRC

Modify your =install= script, so it automatically enables =brew= plugin.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
"${BASEDIR}/${DOTBOT_DIR}/${DOTBOT_BIN}" -d "${BASEDIR}" --plugin-dir dotbot-brew -c "${CONFIG}" "${@}"
#+END_SRC

** Usage

In your =install.conf.yaml= use =brew= directive to list all packages to be
installed using =brew=. The same works with =cask.= For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
- tap:
    - caskroom/fonts

- brew:
    - git
    - git-lfs
    - emacs --with-cocoa --with-gnutls --with-librsvg --with-imagemagick --HEAD --use-git-head

- brew: [gnupg, gnupg2]

- cask: [colorpicker, vlc]
#+END_SRC
